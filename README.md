# Tab-Grouper
- Can group tabs (to the right) without disturbing other groups
- Allows you to name and set the group's color
- Uses keyboard shortcuts (still working on activating the extension with a shortcut).


# File Documentation



# What I learned
- Learned how to utilize the chrome extensions API with Javascript and JSON, along with HTML.
- Learned specifics of advanced Javascript, mainly utilizing promises and async / await capabilities.

# Problems I encountered
When implementing the tabInGroup function (to check if a tab was in a group or not), I ran into a lot of problems with the return values not storing correctly. 
The steps I took to fix this issue were as follows:
- Initially used console logging functionality to check if the function was returning the correct value
- Learned about Promises & how to apply Async / Await capabilities to my Javascript code.
- Re-implemented my code initially using promises, then switched to async and await as that served much better for what I wanted to accomplish.
- Used what I learned for my tabInGroup function to make the rest of my code generally more cleaner.
