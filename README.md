# tab-grouper

Wanted to extend onto the base tutorial level functionality of the google tab grouper.
Most groups of tabs that are more recent tend to be to the right, and the ones you don't really need are on the left
So instead of grouping all the tabs at once, grouping tabs to the right usually seems like the way to go.

Another aim is to be able to add to a tab group without breaking existing tab groups.
